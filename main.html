<h1>Why I want to become a developer?</h1>
<p> I want to become a software developer because I am passionate about creating innovative solutions that solve real-world problems. Technology is constantly evolving, and being a developer allows me to stay at the forefront of that change. I enjoy the process of building applications from scratch, learning new tools and frameworks, and seeing my ideas come to life in the form of code. Moreover, software development offers a great combination of creativity, logic, and continuous learning, which keeps me motivated and excited about my career path.</p>
